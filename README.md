Air Control is a family-owned heating and air conditioning business based in Lafayette and it has been serving the Lamorinda and Central Contra Costa region for more than three decades. Before then, Jim Crowson grew up in El Sobrante and later moved with his wife, Linda, and two sons to Lafayette where he started a heating/air conditioning/HVAC business named Air Control. Over the years, Jim and his family, with help from his friends, built a reputation for high quality work delivered in a timely fashion at a reasonable price. The bottom line is Air Control became a good neighbor while earning the trust from all of its customers.

Furnaces tend to go out when we least expect it the most and furnace repair can end up being very costly. Regular maintenance of your furnace helps the unit to work properly and can prevent future issues. Yearly furnace service can reduce repair costs, increase the efficiency of the system, extend the life of the system and lower your utility bills. Trust our trained personnel and HVAC professionals to help you maintain your furnace and heating system all year around!
